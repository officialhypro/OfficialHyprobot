# Discordians

**DISCLAIMER: Hey ðŸ‘‹ , I am currently working on this project, and hopefully will be done by the end of this year! I am doing the Documentation at the moment, Some parts of the code are out. We will also not be using v13 as it is not fully functional and is bloated in my opinion. We may do a rewrite in the near future!**

Discordians is a Discord Bot that has moderation commands, Economy Commands and even an Levelling System, which is __all__ connected to [MongoDB (Atlas)](https://mongodb.com) and is lightweight and not filled with a bunch of useless and unnessary commands! To see Documentation and how to easily set this Bot up, [click here](https://github.com/oofquest/Disordians#setup) or scroll down!

### Setup
**Note: If you are finding trouble with setting up this bot, please open an issue by [clicking here](https://github.com/oofquest/Disordians/issues)**

Firstly, let's download this. Either [click here](https://github.com/oofquest/Disordians/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) or if you have git installed on your computer do this following command on your terminal and make sure to make a directory/folder before running this command:

```py
git clone https://github.com/oofquest/Disordians
```
You now may see a bunch of files and folders. Well, go to the [configure](https://github.com/oofquest/Discordians/configure) folder, then to [config.json](https://github.com/oofquest/Discordians/configure/config.json). You will now see the following:

Now, let's make a Discord Bot by going to Discord's Developers Portal by clicking this link https://discord.com/developers/applications, and then make a bot and copy the token and paste it to the tokens config.
