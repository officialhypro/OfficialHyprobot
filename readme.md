# Discordians

**DISCLAIMER: Hey ðŸ‘‹ , I am currently working on this project, and hopefully will be done by the end of this month! I am doing the Documentation at the moment, the code is not out as beta yet and is on a private development stage.**

Discordians is a Discord Bot that has moderation commands, Economy Commands and even an Levelling System, which is __all__ connected to [MongoDB (Atlas)](https://mongodb.com) and is lightweight and not filled with a bunch of useless and unnessary commands!
