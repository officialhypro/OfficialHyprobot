# Discordians

**DISCLAIMER: Hey ðŸ‘‹ , I am currently working on this project, and hopefully will be done by the end of this month! I am doing the Documentation at the moment, the code is not out as beta yet and is on a private development stage.**

Discordians is a Discord Bot that has moderation commands, and some fun commands and is connected with MongoDB!


### Setup

Firstly, let's download this. Either [click here](https://github.com/oofquest/Disordians/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) or if you have git installed on your computer do this following command on your terminal and make sure to make a directory/folder before running this command:

```js 
git clone https://github.com/oofquest/Disordians
```
