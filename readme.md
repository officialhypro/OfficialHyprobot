# Discordians

**DISCLAIMER: Hey ðŸ‘‹ , I am currently working on this project, and hopefully will be done by the end of this year! I am doing the Documentation at the moment, Some parts of the code are out. We will also not be using v13 as it is not fully functional and is bloated in my opinion. We may do a rewrite in the near future!**

Discordians is a Discord Bot that has moderation commands, Economy Commands and even an Levelling System, which is __all__ connected to [MongoDB (Atlas)](https://mongodb.com) and is lightweight and not filled with a bunch of useless and unnessary commands!
